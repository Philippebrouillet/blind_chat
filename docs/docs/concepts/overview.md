# Overview
________________________________________________________

In this `concepts` guide, we will explain the key concepts behind our confidential solutions.

Each section in our 'concepts' guide contains an introduction to the concept itself followed by a discussion of how we have implemented these technologies in BlindLLama & BlindChat.

The concepts we will cover are:

  1. [**Enclaves**](./enclaves.md): We introduce the highly isolated secure environments keeping user data private
  2. [**Attestation**](./attestation.md): We discuss how we provide cryptographic guarantees that our security measures are in place
  3. [**Attested TLS**](./TPMs.md): We describe how we verify the identity of our enclave before enabling secure communications to proceed

You can also watch our video to learn about these concepts and how they relate to BlindChat:
